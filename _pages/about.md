Welcome to my Github page! I am currently serving as the Engagement Associate at the **Centre for Sustainable Finance: ToitÅ« Tahua**([https://www.sustainablefinance.nz/]). Prior to this, I held the position of Strategic Postdoctoral Fellow at the **Climate and Energy Finance Group (CEFGroup)**([https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/cefg/]), **University of Otago**([https://www.otago.ac.nz/]).

My primary research interests center around sustainable finance, with applications to corporate finance and financial markets.

You can contact me at: renzhu.zhang [at] otago.ac.nz
