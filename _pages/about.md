Welcome to my Github page! I am currently serving as the Engagement Associate at the **Centre for Sustainable Finance: ToitÅ« Tahua**. Prior to this, I held the position of Strategic Postdoctoral Fellow at the **Climate and Energy Finance Group (CEFGroup)**, **University of Otago**.

My primary research interests center around sustainable finance, with applications to corporate finance and financial markets.
