IAEE Working Paper [R&R; 5th GRASFI Annual Conference Best Paper Award for Climate Finance Research].</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This paper explores the quality of Scope 3 emission data in terms of divergence and composition and the performance of machine learning models in predicting Scope 3 emissions. We do so using the Scope 3 emission datasets of three of the largest data providers (Refinitiv Eikon, and ISS). We find considerable divergence between third party providers, making it difficult for investors to know their ‘ exposure to Scope 3 emissions. Surprisingly, divergence exists between the datasets for emissions values that have been reported by firms (identical data points between Bloomberg and Refinitiv Eikon). The divergence is even larger for ISS when it adjusts reported values using its proprietary models ( identical data points). With respect to the composition of Scope 3 emissions, firms generally report incomplete compositions, yet they are reporting more categories over time. There is a persistent contrast between relevance and completeness in the composition of Scope 3 emissions across sectors, as irrelevant categories such as travel emissions are reported more frequently than relevant ones, such as the use of products and processing of sold products We also find that the application of machine learning algorithms can improve the prediction accuracy of the aggregated Scope 3 emissions (up to 6%) and its components, especially when each category is estimated individually and aggregated into the total Scope 3 emissions values (up to 25%). It is easier to predict upstream emissions than downstream e missions. Prediction performance is primarily limited by low observations in particular categories, and predictor importance varies by category. We conclude that users of the Scope 3 emission datasets should consider data source, quality and prediction errors when using data from third party providers in their risk analyses.</p>

SSRN Working Paper [2022 New Zealand Finance Meeting CFA Asia Pacific Research Exchange Award].</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Using a novel survey of retail global equity funds offered in Australasia, we provide new insights into the evolving landscape of responsible investing (RI) and potential greenwashing. Our analysis has three components. First, we surveyed asset managers to elicit an understanding of how and why they integrate ESG information into investment decisions. We found that RI was primarily driven by performance and fund flow focused value, rather than ethical values. Further, we found that climate change themes were prioritised within the investment process, relative to other ESG sub-themes. Second, we compared survey responses to portfolio holdings data to evaluate whether fund managers were as environmentally responsible as they claimed to be. Surprisingly, we found that portfolio carbon intensity was significantly higher for respondents that were members of a climate initiative, and not significantly different for those that prioritised climate change themes or engaged in a decarbonisation strategy. The divergence between words and actions appears to be consistent with greenwashing funds (‘lemons’) seeking responsible investment flows without ‘walking the talk’. Third, we evaluated the determinants of carbon and ESG performance across our entire sample of survey respondents and non-respondents. We found that the ESG named funds had similar emissions intensities and inconsistent ESG performance, across three major external rating providers, relative to non ESG named funds.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Using a unique European dataset, we examine 'green' (renewable energy) and 'gray' (non-renewable energy) IPOs in terms of ownership characteristics, probability of withdrawal, post-withdrawal survival and post-IPO performance. We find greater private equity and venture capital involvement, as well as higher levels of retained ownership, for green IPOs. Gray firms disproportionately list on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM), which has a low regulatory burden relative to other European markets. Green firms are less likely to withdraw in recent years, survive longer and are less likely to be sold post-withdrawal. These results, indicating a positive market and 'insider' sentiment toward green firms, suggest insiders of gray firms are more often motivated by a desire to 'exit'. For firms that list, green firms underperform post-IPO, producing significantly more negative BHARs relative to benchmark indices and negative BHARs, though lacks statistical significance, relative gray firms. Green IPOs are also found to produce lower alphas in the four-factor regressions. This difference in performance is, however, decreasing/disappearing over time!</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Using a nationally representative survey of New Zealanders conducted in 2020, this study investigates households’ preferences and attitudes with respect to ethical investing (EI). Our results suggest that stated adopters of EI funds are well informed about what EI is (25.5% more likely to adopt), trust EI providers (11.2%) and interestingly prefer exclusion over engagement (9.7%). Given that there is a shift in New Zealand towards engagement this raises concerns about whether investment managers are delivering what ethical investors want. An analysis of interaction effects shows that higher EI knowledge increases the probability of adoption for Baby Boomers, those that prefer exclusions (marginally so), and investors that perceived greater environmental effectiveness and trust in EI providers. Our regression for EI investment performance shows that EI adopters are much more likely to perceive better returns from ethical investments (15.6%) than potential adopters and those not interested in adopting, suggesting that those that claim to have adopted EI have had a good return experience. However, stated adopters are not more willing to sacrifice returns to invest ethically compared to non-adopters.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This study investigates the developing market of private debt (PD) in New Zealand and globally through a novel questionnaire distributed to institutional asset managers and owners. The research explores the barriers and opportunities associated with PD investment, particularly in relation to sustainable investing. The findings reveal that PD investment is more common among larger, sophisticated investors with private market experience and a commitment to ESG through climate initiatives, emissions measurement, and willingness to pay a premium for green/sustainable labelled debt. While PD investment is perceived to be associated with greater impact goals, the preference for fixed interest due to liquidity and familiarity remains a barrier to investment. The research highlights the potential for expanding the PD market in New Zealand through education efforts, and the potential for PD investment to support sustainability and economic growth.</p>
