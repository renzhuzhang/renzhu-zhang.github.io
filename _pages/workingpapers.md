<p style='text-align: justify;'>Nguyen, Q., Diaz-Rainey, I., Kitto, A., McNeil, B., Pittman, N., & Zhang, R. (2022). Scope 3 Emissions: Data Quality and Machine Learning Prediction Accuracy, [SSRN Working Paper]([https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract =4191648])</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This paper explores the quality of Scope 3 emission data in terms of divergence and composition and the performance of machine learning models in predicting Scope 3 emissions. We do so using the Scope 3 emission datasets of three of the largest data providers (Refinitiv Eikon, and ISS). We find considerable divergence between third party providers, making it difficult for investors to know their ‘ exposure to Scope 3 emissions. Surprisingly, divergence exists between the datasets for emissions values that have been reported by firms (identical data points between Bloomberg and Refinitiv Eikon). The divergence is even larger for ISS when it adjusts reported values using its proprietary models ( identical data points). With respect to the composition of Scope 3 emissions, firms generally report incomplete compositions, yet they are reporting more categories over time. There is a persistent contrast between relevance and completeness in the composition of Scope 3 emissions across sectors, as irrelevant categories such as travel emissions are reported more frequently than relevant ones, such as the use of products and processing of sold products We also find that the application of machine learning algorithms can improve the prediction accuracy of the aggregated Scope 3 emissions (up to 6%) and its components, especially when each category is estimated individually and aggregated into the total Scope 3 emissions values (up to 25%). It is easier to predict upstream emissions than downstream e missions. Prediction performance is primarily limited by low observations in particular categories, and predictor importance varies by category. We conclude that users of the Scope 3 emission datasets should consider data source, quality and prediction errors when using data from third party providers in their risk analyses.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Diaz-Rainey, I., Roberts, H., Zhang, R., Coates, B., & Genç, M. (2022).100% Pure? Households' Preferences and Attitudes with Respect to Ethical Investing.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Using a nationally representative survey of New Zealanders conducted in 2020, this study investigates households’ preferences and attitudes with respect to ethical investing (EI). Our results suggest that stated adopters of EI funds are well informed about what EI is (25.5% more likely to adopt), trust EI providers (11.2%) and interestingly prefer exclusion over engagement (9.7%). Given that there is a shift in New Zealand towards engagement this raises concerns about whether investment managers are delivering what ethical investors want. An analysis of interaction effects shows that higher EI knowledge increases the probability of adoption for Baby Boomers, those that prefer exclusions (marginally so), and investors that perceived greater environmental effectiveness and trust in EI providers. Our regression for EI investment performance shows that EI adopters are much more likely to perceive better returns from ethical investments (15.6%) than potential adopters and those not interested in adopting, suggesting that those that claim to have adopted EI have had a good return experience. However, stated adopters are not more willing to sacrifice returns to invest ethically compared to non-adopters.</p>
